# Comprehensive Database Comparison
This project will attempt to make a comprehensive comparison of open source databases based on different load types and implement this senarios in different databases. It will compare many parameters as to performance, scalability and size of different argitechtures from time-series (key/value) to relational and object databases.

Ansible is used in order for benchmarking on a broad amount of OSs and hardware.
